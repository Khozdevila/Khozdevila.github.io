mission:
  title: Our Mission
  text: >
    At the Centre for Computational Medicine, we perform foundational computational biomedical engineering research where imaging and modelling meet to tackle modern medicine's most pressing unmet clinical needs.

problem:
  title: The Problem
  text: >
    Medical technology is developing so quickly that it has outpaced our ability to test for safety and efficacy, hence delaying benefits to patients and healthcare systems.

oportunity:
  title: The Oportunity
  text: >
    Scientific evidence generated by computer-based trials (aka in silico trials) of medical products is poised to transform how health science research as well as regulations are conducted. It can reduce, refine, and partially replace the need for laboratory tests, animal experiments, and human clinical trials. This allows faster, safer, and more cost-effective medical innovations that benefit patients and improve economic growth. 
    <br/><br/>
    UK can take a leadership position in in silico trials, which would cement its position as a global leader in health and life sciences, help drive the UK economy, and provide UK citizens with early access to innovative health products.

approach:
  title: Our Approach
  text: >
    Our work lies at the crossroads of medical image analysis and modelling with an emphasis on machine learning and computational physiology.
    <br/><br/>
    Through <b>Computational Medicine</b>, we advance healthcare by developing computational models of disease and personalising these models using complex, real-world patient data. By applying the models, we improve disease diagnosis and treatment as well as produce regulatory evidence of the safety and efficacy of medical products to tackle cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal disorders, and cancer.
